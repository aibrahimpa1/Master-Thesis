- Analyzing the impact of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) when it meets Network virtual functions (NFV) as well as the impact of user context information on stateful network functions in order to make better predictions.
- Analyzing real mobile users' data gathered in the Geolife GPS project and training of a Mixture density neural network on that data.
- Creating and training of a neural network model for the prediction of the probability of stay for each individual pedestrian independently using a shared model.
- Creating a numerical simulation which showed that our proposed method can effectively improve the reliability of EC services in the context of unstable security network functions in central cloud, while being capable to keep a flexible balance between the MEC reliability and the operations cost.
